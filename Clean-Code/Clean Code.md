### There Will Be Code
There will always be code, no matter how much higher level it can get. We can write tools that write code for us. But they have to be provided with a specification. That specification is code.

### What is Clean Code?
>I like me code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.

**- Bjarne Stroustrup, inventor of C++ and author of The C++ Programming Language.**


> Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like a well=written prose. Clean code never obscures the designer’s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.

**- Grady Booch, author of Object Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications**


> I could list all of the qualities that I notice in clean code, but there is one overarching quality that leads to all of them. Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious that you can do to make it better. All of those things were thought about by the code’s author, and if you try to imagine improvements, you’re led back to where you are, sitting in appreciation of the code someone left for you - code left by someone who cares deeply about the craft.

**- Michael Feathers, author of Working Effectively with Legacy Code**


> You know you are working with clean code when each routine you read turns out to be exactly what you expected. You can call it beautiful code when the code also makes it look like the language was made for the problem.

**- Ward Cunningham, inventor of Wiki inventor of Fit, co-inventor of eXtreme Programming. Motive force behind Design Patterns, Smalltalk and OO thought leader. The godfather of all those who care about code.**


### We Are Authors
And we have readers. So write your code thinking about the reader. Making code easy to read actually makes it easier to write.


### The Boy Scout Rule
Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
